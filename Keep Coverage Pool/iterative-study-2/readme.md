# 🌐 Overview
The idea of the Usability Tests is to uncover what is intuitive and what is not in our layouts as well as uncovering what information is missing and what is confusing. 
We will have 2 distinct tasks that will be designed to test:
* the deposit flow
* the withdraw flow
* the timeline visual explanation of the protocol

We will also talk to KEEP users but also non-KEEP users.

## 🎯 Study Goals
In previous studies we have discovered that:
* the entire flow was extremely complex and users did not entirely understand it.
* most of the important information was ignored and the users would only read it when panic hit.
In this study we want to find:
* if the timeline display helps users understand how the protocol works
* discover worst friction points
* measure error rate
* task success
* task time
* learnability
* post task - SEQ

### 💬 Methodology
We are going to talk to X people both KEEP and non-Keep users to find out if the Deposit flows and Withdraw flows are intuitive and easily understandable. Also we are aiming to test if the new timeline display of the protocol helps users understand easier. 
* Define the user profile we want to talk to - people with some DeFi experience
* Design a screener for the recruiting announcement - screener
* Schedule interviews - 45 min 
* Topics - 
  * Blockchain knowledge - self assessed
  * Actively staking behaviour - needs, missing features.
  * 
  * Deposit Flow Walkthrough
  * Exit Flow Walkthrough
* Document
* Analyze
