# 🌐 Overview

The idea of the Usability tests is to uncover what is intuitive and what is not in our layouts as well as uncovering what information is missing and what is confusing. 
We will also talk to non-KEEP users

## 💬 Methodology

We are going to talk to 11 people both KEEP and non-Keep users to find out if the Deposit flows and Exit flows are intuitive and easily understandable.
* Define the user profile we want to talk to - people with some DeFi experience
* Design a screener for the recruiting announcement - screener
* Schedule interviews - 45 min 
* Topics - 
  * blockchain knowledge - self assessed
  * DeFi favorite protocol
  * 5 seconds test - Overview page
  * Deposit Flow Walkthrough
  * Exit Flow Walkthrough
