# 🌐Overview

## 🎯 Goals

* Map out thoughts and ideas about the tBTC users
* Get team alignment on which are the possible riskiest scenarios
* Identify the whole possible range of users for tBTC users - this might be done as a survey on its own
* Narrow down the most important users for tBTC users - from the Assumption mapping Workshop the team stated that the most important usersfor tBTC are the ones who will mint and unmint several times.
* Identify team’s blind spots on tBTC and BTC user behaviours
* Probe our assumptions with real data

## 🎯 Study Goals

### 🕵️‍♀️ Topics that resulted to dig deeper in our future user research:

* are BTC users actually interested in bridging their assets?
* find out (renBTC, WBTC, or any other bridge) bridge user behaviours - do these users ever unmint their tokens? 
* get a sense of the bridged assets BTC owners views upon taxes. 
* are taxable events important for them?
* is really permissionless non-custodial fully decentralized bridge a priority among the users who are bridging BTC assets?
* are really BTC owners against KYC? Or would they prefer to use a product with zero KYC over one with KYC?
* are incentives/rewards good enough to overcome the potential risks for tBTC stakers? - separate study
* are users preferring instant minting over decentralization?
* will users find the 8h sweeping time too long?

### 💬 Methodology

The research study methodology is the following one:

* Define the user profile we want to talk to -
  * BTC holders 
  * WBTC holders
  * renBTC holders
  * BTC Bridge users
  * bridge users ( we might find interesting data from this cohort as well)
* Design a screener for the recruiting announcement - screener
* Schedule interviews - 45 min or 60 min interviews - will define the exact duration after the script is finalised 
* Topics -  Hi level interview agenda
  * General, warm-up
