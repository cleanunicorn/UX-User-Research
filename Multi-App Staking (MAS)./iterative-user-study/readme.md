# üåêOverview

We will test the Staking Flow alongside with the Multiple Application Authorization Flow for existing stakers and new stakers. 
The Staking flow has never been tested out before so it is an opportunity to bring improvements to this flow as well since the Stakers are the backbone of our network.
Additional Context:
* PRE application was believed it needs authorization, it turned out it‚Äôs already authorized for existing stakers. 
* Existing Stakers who have set an Authorizer Address different from the Owner Address are required to take a separate route to authorize their stakes.

## üéØ Goals

* Map out thoughts and feelings about the Staking Process and the Staking Requirements
* Identify the possible issues and misalignments with the users‚Äô mental models
* Uncover the friction points in the Staking and MAS User Journey
* Identify team‚Äôs blind spots on Staking and MAS
* Probe our assumptions with real data

### üéØ Study Goals

* learn more about possible future stakers
* learn more about Threshold Stakers
* discover pain points and turn them into opportunities
* test our current product flows
* probe our current User Journey Map

### üí¨ Methodology

The research study methodology is the following one:

* Define the user profile we want to talk to - node operators have been uncovered as the most important users for Threshold Network. We‚Äôll talk to 5 existing Threshold Stakers and 5 participants who have the staker knowledge but currently are not Threshold Network Stakers.
* Design a screener for the recruiting announcement - screener
* Schedule interviews - 45 min or 60 min interviews - will define the exact duration after the script is finalised 
* Topics -  Hi level interview agenda
  * General, warm-up
  * Background in blockchain - experience, savviness, node operation experience/staker experience
* Non Threshold Staker
  * Staker experience
    * When did they start being a staker?
    * Which network are they staker/node operator for?
    * Why did they become stakers for x?
    * What is the process to become a staker for X?
    * What would they change from X staking process?
    * What do they like the most from X staking process?
    * What keeps them up at night as a staker?
    * What would make them stop staking on X?
  * 5 seconds test - Staking Banner
  * Task 1 - Stake into the Threshold Network
  * SEQ
  * Task 2 - Authorize an/another app
  * SEQ
  * Task 3 - Decrease the authorization of an app
  * SEQ
  * Read out loud walkthrough - How it works page
