# 🌐Overview
We will test the Staking Flow alongside with the Multiple Application Authorization Flow for existing stakers and new stakers. 
The Staking flow has never been tested out before so it is an opportunity to bring improvements to this flow as well since the Stakers are the backbone of our network.
Additional Context:
* PRE application was believed it needs authorization, it turned out it’s already authorized for existing stakers. 
* Existing Stakers who have set an Authorizer Address different from the Owner Address are required to take a separate route to authorize their stakes.

## 🎯 Goals
* Map out thoughts and feelings about the Staking Process and the Staking Requirements
* Identify the possible issues and misalignments with the users’ mental models
* Uncover the friction points in the Staking and MAS User Journey
* Identify team’s blind spots on Staking and MAS
* Probe our assumptions with real data
