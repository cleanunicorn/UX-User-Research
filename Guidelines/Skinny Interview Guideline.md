## The brain dump/ Assumption Mapping
The objective for this is to get out of our heads what hunches we have, assumptions theories, opinions closely held, different beliefs and hypothesis.
This exercise is not about correct or wrong answers is about shaking up what is in our minds. We can make an anonymous board and write our assumptions. 
This document will be our starting point for the Interview Script.

###Before the interview

The interview is not about your opinions is about your users’ opinions so you should think of what you are there to accomplish:
* 👓 learning about your users
* 🤯 uncovering things that you have never thought of
* 🤗 embracing how other people see the world
Be ready to ask questions for which you think you know the answer

You may already have an idea about how your participant does some things from different mediums or by something she said during the interview, or assume because this is the fifth person you have interviewed and you start to see a pattern.
However refrain from not asking the question and ask it anyway. Do not be afraid of asking extra details. You are there to learn about your users and usually people are happy to show and talk if they are listened to.
👩‍🏫 They are the expert and you the novice.

### Before interview - Interviewer prepping

* take care in advance of your food, drink and restroom needs in advance ( I learned it the hard way, needing badly to pee will make you lose your focus)
* setup your devices before hand so when the interview starts you have everything working soundly 
  * 🎧 check your headphones 
  * 🎥 check your camera
  * 📄 check that you have your interview script at hand
  * 🔗 check that your Zoom link is working properly 
* go through the script before starting the interview so you can get in the interview mindset, I like to read it out loud before every interview
* get on the call before your participant and calm your breath, most of them will run a bit late, just enough to forget you were nervous
* silence your mobile phone, and other apps that might produce sounds and noises, all of these will break the participant’s narrative and focus

During the interview you should be fully engaged with your participant. People tend to lose their interest if you are not interested, And after all why would you be interested in something else? You are there to pick this person’s brains which is a very nice opportunity. Don’t miss your chance!
* do not check your e-mail
* put your phone away from you
* do not read on the latest post on your discord server while running an interview
Build rapport 
😵After an interview you will usually be in a state between energized and exhausted, I am usually exhausted and lifeless.

You not only harvested a lot of new information but you have also made an intense connection with a totally new person.
👀 It’s your job to develop rapport by the course of the user interview. By all means recruit participants who are articulate, outgoing, and eager to be part of the interview. 
🙋‍♀️ Of course you will run into participants who aren’t so open but patient and stay curious.

Listening and reacting
👂 Listen actively, give your participant feedback in order for the to understand that you are listening to them:
* nod
* mumble an “uhum” every now and then
* look them in the eye
* if your brain listens your body listens as well
Be mindful of your body language and your metalanguage - different gesture or grimaces may influence the way you participant will talk to you. The course of the interview may take a different turn and this might result in spoiled data.
⛔ Do not say things like “ interesting” “really?” “me, too”. You are not there to judge what your users tell you, you are there to absorb all the information.
